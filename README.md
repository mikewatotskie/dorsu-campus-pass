# DOrSU Digital Campus Pass

ITMSD 1 - Laboratory Exercise 03. Expo SDK 57, React 19, React Native and strict TypeScript.

## Run

Use Node.js 22.13+ (Node 24 LTS recommended). From this folder:
Use the Terminal use Powershell to run copy and paste the 2 commands below. 
```sh
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the Metro QR code with a compatible Expo Go app on your phone (same Wi-Fi), or press `a` for a configured Android emulator. Press `w` for a browser preview. If LAN discovery fails, use `npx expo start --tunnel` and follow Expo's dependency prompt. Do not install the obsolete global expo-cli package.

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run build:web
```

## App behavior

- StudentCard receives immutable, typed student data and pass status.
- ScanCounter receives its count and callbacks from App.
- Scan increments from 0 using `setGateScans(prev => prev + 1)`; Reset returns to 0.
- Suspension changes only the main pass badge and toggle label; as in the guide's simulator, scanning remains a separate demonstration control.
- The peer demo reuses StudentCard with different props; its status remains active.
- State is in memory and resets on a full reload. The count is a demo-session total, not a persisted daily attendance record.
- The bundled avatar works offline. Set avatarUrl for a remote image; a failed image falls back to the local asset.

## Personalize

Edit `src/data/student.ts` with your own details. Both profiles currently come from the guide and are labeled SAMPLE ID. Update that label and the sample-identities footer if you replace the sample data. Keep personal data exposure in mind before publishing a public repository; the sample data can remain in the public demo if your instructor permits it.

The six exercise commits record AI-assisted construction of this project under a generic builder identity. They are not evidence that the student personally performed those exercises. Review, explain, and adapt the implementation, and follow your instructor's AI-assistance policy.
